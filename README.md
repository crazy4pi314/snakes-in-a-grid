## Tutorial Preparation

There are two main ways we will be wokring with spreadsheets, from Python and from a spreadsheet editor. There are instructions below for how to make sure you have an environment ready for each tool!

> tl;dr make sure you have an authenticator app on your phone and can start a codespace on this repo (see button below)

### Working from the Python side

You will need a python 3.13 env setup with the requirements.txt in this repo, or you can use the devcontainer already configured locally with VS Code or in Codespaces right here in your browser:

### Working from the spreadsheet editor side

There are many different spreasheet tools that which are great for working with data like Libre Office Calc, Excel, Google Sheets, and extensions for VS Code and PyCharm. You are free to use whichever you like for this tutorial, but there are a few features we will be covering that so far are only available in Excel (namely running Python directly in the cells!). To ensure that everyone can try out this feature, we will have M365 logins setup that will allow you to use the excel features directly in your browser! All you will need is an authenticator app on your phone (Microsoft Authenticator, Google Authenticator, Aegis Authenticator, etc.) to log in to the demo tenant.

If you are interested in getting the Python in Excel features on your own M365 licence/tenant see the instructions here:
